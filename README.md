# Welcome to Mei's User Page!

I know I am supposed to say something on this website but I don't what to say.

Javascript is my favorite programming language! (Nah.

## First, a little bit about myself

Hi, this is Meijiang! I go by Mei, and this is my github page constructed for my CSE 110 Lab1 :)

# ”I know your name, so who are you？“

I am a second year Mathematics-Computer Science students studying in [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/)!

# "Okay... That's a little bit about you, so what?"

So here are some of the most wonderful things for me in this world;
1. Watching **sci-fi movies and series** while lying on my bed, and here are some of my favorite ones:
   - *Black Mirror*
   - *The Matrix*
   - *Waterworld*
2. Making and eating **chocolate cakes**
   [Like this one](https://img.buzzfeed.com/thumbnailer-prod-us-east-1/video-api/assets/109778.jpg?output-format=auto&output-quality=auto)
3. **skiing** (although I am not good at it)
4. Going to the **amusement parks** (especially the roller coaster!!!), and sleeping(hope this one counts).

# "Interesting"

Oh and here is my favorite quote from my mom:

> Don't come back too late

And my favorite program.

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}
```
# "Really interesting... especially the quote"

One last thing! Here are some goals I made for the beginning of 2021
- [x] Survive through Winter Quarter Week 1
- [ ] Complete my internship
- [ ] Not eat too many chocolate cakes

## Nice to Meet You!
